# Imperfect Competition

## 1. Imperfect Competition: Assumptions and Behavior
**Imperfect competition** refers to market structures that lie between perfect competition and monopoly, where firms have some degree of market power.

### Assumptions of Imperfect Competition
- Firms **sell differentiated products** (except in oligopoly with homogeneous goods).
- There is **some degree of price-setting power**.
- **Entry and exit** are possible but may have barriers.
- Firms engage in **strategic behavior** to compete.

### Behavior in Imperfectly Competitive Markets
- Firms focus on **non-price competition**, such as advertising and branding.
- They may engage in **strategic pricing**, including discounts and price matching.
- There is **mutual interdependence**, especially in oligopolies.

## 2. Monopolistic Competition: Assumptions and Behavior
A **monopolistic competition** market consists of many firms selling similar but differentiated products.

### Assumptions of Monopolistic Competition
- **Many sellers** compete for market share.
- **Differentiated products** through branding, quality, or service.
- **Easy entry and exit** in the long run.
- **Some price-setting power** due to brand loyalty.

### Behavior in Monopolistic Competition
- Firms spend heavily on **advertising and marketing**.
- In the **short run**, firms may earn **economic profits or losses**.
- In the **long run**, **entry erodes profits**, leading to **zero economic profit**.
- Firms operate with **excess capacity**, producing less than the lowest cost output.

## 3. Oligopoly: Assumptions and Behavior
An **oligopoly** is a market dominated by a few large firms, which may produce identical or differentiated products.

### Assumptions of Oligopoly
- **Few large firms** dominate the market.
- Products may be **homogeneous (e.g., oil) or differentiated (e.g., automobiles)**.
- **High barriers to entry**, including economies of scale and brand loyalty.
- **Mutual interdependence**: Firms consider rivals' reactions when making decisions.

### Behavior in Oligopoly
- **Collusion**: Firms may agree to fix prices (illegal in many countries).
- **Price rigidity**: Firms are reluctant to change prices due to the "kinked demand curve".
- **Strategic behavior**: Pricing and marketing decisions consider rival responses.
- **Non-price competition**: Heavy investment in advertising, R&D, and product differentiation.

## 4. Game Theory
Game theory studies strategic decision-making, particularly relevant in **oligopolies**.

### Simultaneous Games
- Players make decisions **at the same time**, without knowing rivals' choices.
- **Prisonerâ€™s Dilemma**: Demonstrates why firms may not collude even when cooperation is beneficial.

### Sequential Games
- Players make decisions **one after another**, allowing firms to react to rivals.
- **First-mover advantage**: The first firm to act may gain a market edge.
- **Threats and commitments**: Firms may use credible threats to influence rivals' behavior.

## 5. Oligopoly in Practice

### Types of Cooperative Behavior
- **Price leadership**: One firm sets a price that others follow.
- **Tacit collusion**: Firms indirectly coordinate prices and output.
- **Cartels**: Formal agreements to fix prices and restrict output (e.g., OPEC).

### Types of Competitive Behavior
- **Price wars**: Firms aggressively lower prices to gain market share.
- **Advertising battles**: Heavy spending on marketing to attract consumers.
- **Innovation races**: Competing through technological advancements.

### Importance of Barriers to Entry
- **Economies of scale**: Large firms have cost advantages.
- **Brand loyalty**: Established firms have stronger customer bases.
- **Legal barriers**: Patents and government regulations limit competition.

Understanding imperfect competition helps analyze real-world markets where firms interact strategically, balancing cooperation and competition.
