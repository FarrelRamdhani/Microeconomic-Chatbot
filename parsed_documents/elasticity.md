# Elasticity

## Price Elasticity of Demand (PED)

### Definition
Price elasticity of demand measures the responsiveness of **quantity demanded** to changes in **price**. It is calculated as:

\[ PED = \frac{\% \text{change in quantity demanded}}{\% \text{change in price}} \]

### Measurement of PED
PED can take different values:
- **Elastic Demand (PED > 1)**: Quantity demanded is highly responsive to price changes.
- **Inelastic Demand (PED < 1)**: Quantity demanded is less responsive to price changes.
- **Unit Elastic Demand (PED = 1)**: Proportional response in quantity demanded to price change.
- **Perfectly Elastic Demand (PED = ∞)**: A tiny price change leads to an infinite change in quantity demanded.
- **Perfectly Inelastic Demand (PED = 0)**: Quantity demanded remains unchanged regardless of price changes.

### Determinants of PED
1. **Availability of Substitutes**: More substitutes → higher elasticity.
2. **Proportion of Income Spent**: Higher proportion → greater elasticity.
3. **Necessity vs. Luxury**: Necessities → inelastic; Luxuries → elastic.
4. **Time Horizon**: Demand is more elastic in the long run.
5. **Definition of Market**: Narrowly defined goods have more elastic demand.

### Elasticity and Total Revenue
- **Elastic Demand**: Price decrease → total revenue increases.
- **Inelastic Demand**: Price decrease → total revenue decreases.
- **Unit Elastic Demand**: Total revenue remains unchanged when price changes.

## Price Elasticity of Supply (PES)

### Definition
Price elasticity of supply measures the responsiveness of **quantity supplied** to changes in **price**. It is calculated as:

\[ PES = \frac{\% \text{change in quantity supplied}}{\% \text{change in price}} \]

### Measurement of PES
- **Elastic Supply (PES > 1)**: Quantity supplied responds significantly to price changes.
- **Inelastic Supply (PES < 1)**: Quantity supplied responds minimally to price changes.
- **Unit Elastic Supply (PES = 1)**: Proportional response of supply to price change.
- **Perfectly Elastic Supply (PES = ∞)**: Any price decrease eliminates supply.
- **Perfectly Inelastic Supply (PES = 0)**: Supply remains unchanged regardless of price changes.

### Determinants of PES
1. **Availability of Inputs**: Easier access to inputs → more elastic supply.
2. **Time Horizon**: Supply is more elastic in the long run.
3. **Production Complexity**: Simple production processes → higher elasticity.
4. **Spare Production Capacity**: More spare capacity → more elastic supply.
5. **Storage Capability**: Easier storage → greater elasticity.

## Elasticity and Excise Taxes
Excise taxes are imposed on goods such as gasoline and alcohol. The burden of the tax depends on elasticity:
- **Inelastic Demand**: Consumers bear most of the tax burden.
- **Elastic Demand**: Producers bear most of the tax burden.
- **Inelastic Supply**: Producers bear most of the tax burden.
- **Elastic Supply**: Consumers bear most of the tax burden.

## Income Elasticity of Demand (YED)

### Definition
Income elasticity of demand measures the responsiveness of **quantity demanded** to changes in **income**. It is calculated as:

\[ YED = \frac{\% \text{change in quantity demanded}}{\% \text{change in income}} \]

### Types of Income Elasticity
- **Normal Goods (YED > 0)**: Demand increases as income rises.
- **Luxury Goods (YED > 1)**: Demand increases more than proportionally with income.
- **Inferior Goods (YED < 0)**: Demand decreases as income rises.

## Cross Elasticity of Demand (XED)

### Definition
Cross elasticity of demand measures the responsiveness of **quantity demanded** of one good to changes in **the price of another good**. It is calculated as:

\[ XED = \frac{\% \text{change in quantity demanded of Good A}}{\% \text{change in price of Good B}} \]

### Types of Cross Elasticity
- **Substitutes (XED > 0)**: An increase in the price of one good increases the demand for another (e.g., Coke and Pepsi).
- **Complements (XED < 0)**: An increase in the price of one good decreases the demand for another (e.g., coffee and sugar).
- **Unrelated Goods (XED = 0)**: No relationship between goods.

Understanding elasticity is crucial for businesses and policymakers in pricing, taxation, and market analysis.
