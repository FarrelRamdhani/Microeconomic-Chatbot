# Demand and Supply

## Demand

### Definition of Demand
Demand refers to the quantity of a good or service that consumers are willing and able to purchase at various prices over a specific period.

### The Law of Demand
The law of demand states that, **ceteris paribus** (holding other factors constant), as the price of a good decreases, the quantity demanded increases, and vice versa. This results in a **negatively sloped demand curve**.

### Slope of the Demand Curve
The demand curve has a downward slope due to:
- **Income Effect**: A lower price increases the purchasing power of consumers, allowing them to buy more.
- **Substitution Effect**: As the price of a good falls, it becomes relatively cheaper compared to substitutes, leading consumers to buy more.
- **Diminishing Marginal Utility**: Additional units of a good provide less satisfaction, so consumers will only buy more if the price is lower.

### Shifts in the Demand Curve
A shift in the demand curve occurs when factors other than price change. These include:
- **Changes in Income**: Higher income increases demand for normal goods but decreases demand for inferior goods.
- **Changes in Tastes and Preferences**: Trends, advertising, and societal changes influence demand.
- **Changes in Prices of Related Goods**:
  - **Substitutes**: An increase in the price of one good increases the demand for its substitute.
  - **Complements**: A decrease in the price of one good increases the demand for its complement.
- **Changes in Population**: More consumers lead to higher demand.
- **Expectations of Future Prices**: If consumers expect higher prices in the future, current demand increases.

## Supply

### Definition of Supply
Supply refers to the quantity of a good or service that producers are willing and able to offer for sale at various prices over a given period.

### The Law of Supply
The law of supply states that, **ceteris paribus**, as the price of a good increases, the quantity supplied increases, and vice versa. This results in a **positively sloped supply curve**.

### Slope of the Supply Curve
The supply curve has an upward slope due to:
- **Profit Motive**: Higher prices provide incentives for producers to supply more.
- **Increasing Marginal Cost**: As production expands, costs per unit typically rise, requiring higher prices to cover costs.

### Shifts in the Supply Curve
A shift in the supply curve occurs when non-price factors change. These include:
- **Changes in Input Prices**: Higher costs of production reduce supply.
- **Technological Advancements**: Improved technology lowers production costs and increases supply.
- **Taxes and Subsidies**: Higher taxes reduce supply, while subsidies increase supply.
- **Prices of Other Goods**: If producers can switch production, an increase in the price of an alternative good reduces the supply of the original good.
- **Number of Suppliers**: More suppliers increase market supply.
- **Expectations of Future Prices**: If producers expect higher prices, they may reduce current supply.

## Equilibrium and Market Stability

### Market Equilibrium
Equilibrium occurs where **quantity demanded equals quantity supplied**, determining the market price and quantity.

- **Excess Demand (Shortage)**: Occurs when demand exceeds supply, pushing prices up.
- **Excess Supply (Surplus)**: Occurs when supply exceeds demand, pushing prices down.

### Stability of Equilibrium
Markets tend toward equilibrium due to price adjustments:
- If price is too high, excess supply leads to price reductions.
- If price is too low, excess demand leads to price increases.

### Laws Governing Demand and Supply
- **Law of Demand**: Higher prices lead to lower quantity demanded, and vice versa.
- **Law of Supply**: Higher prices lead to higher quantity supplied, and vice versa.
- **Law of Market Equilibrium**: Markets adjust prices to clear excess supply or demand.

Understanding demand and supply helps analyze market behavior and predict how economic forces influence prices and production.
