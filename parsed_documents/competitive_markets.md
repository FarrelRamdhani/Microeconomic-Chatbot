# Competitive Markets

## 1. Market Structure and Firm Behavior
Market structure refers to the characteristics of a market that influence the behavior and performance of firms. Competitive markets are defined by:
- A **large number of small firms**
- **Homogeneous products**
- **Perfect information** for buyers and sellers
- **Free entry and exit** of firms

Firms in competitive markets are **price takers**, meaning they cannot influence market prices and must accept the prevailing equilibrium price.

## 2. Theory of Perfect Competition

### Assumptions of Perfect Competition
1. **Many buyers and sellers**: Each firm has a negligible impact on price.
2. **Identical (homogeneous) products**: Consumers do not differentiate between suppliers.
3. **Perfect information**: Buyers and sellers have full knowledge of prices and production methods.
4. **Free entry and exit**: Firms can enter or leave the industry without barriers.
5. **No government intervention**: Prices are determined by market forces.

### Demand Curve for the Firm
- A perfectly competitive firm faces a **perfectly elastic demand curve** (horizontal at market price).
- Since firms are price takers, any attempt to charge above the market price results in zero sales.

### Revenue Curves for the Firm
- **Total Revenue (TR) = Price × Quantity Sold**
- **Average Revenue (AR) = TR / Q = Price**
- **Marginal Revenue (MR) = Change in TR / Change in Q**
- In perfect competition, **AR = MR = Price**

## 3. Profit Maximization
A firm maximizes profit where:
\[ MR = MC \]
- If **MR > MC**, the firm should increase output.
- If **MR < MC**, the firm should reduce output.
- Profit is maximized when **MR = MC**.

## 4. Short-Run Production Decisions

### Profit Maximization in the Short Run
- A firm continues producing as long as total revenue covers **variable costs**.
- The **shut-down point** occurs when price falls below **minimum average variable cost (AVC)**.

### Short-Run Supply
- The **firm’s supply curve** is the portion of its **marginal cost (MC) curve** above **AVC**.
- Industry supply is the sum of all firms’ individual supply curves.

### Short-Run Equilibrium
- **Market equilibrium** occurs where market supply equals market demand.
- Firms may experience **economic profits, losses, or normal profits** in the short run.

### Industry Short-Run Supply
- Industry supply shifts due to changes in:
  - Input costs
  - Number of firms
  - Technological advancements

## 5. Long-Run Production Decisions

### Long-Run Adjustment: Entry and Exit
- **If firms earn economic profits**, new firms enter, increasing supply and lowering price until profits are zero.
- **If firms incur losses**, some firms exit, decreasing supply and raising price until losses are eliminated.

### Long-Run Equilibrium
- Firms earn **zero economic profit** (normal profit), where **P = MC = ATC**.
- Firms operate at the lowest point of **long-run average cost (LRAC)**, achieving **productive efficiency**.
- **Allocative efficiency** is reached when **P = MC**, meaning resources are optimally allocated.

### Changes in Technology
- Technological advancements lower production costs, shifting **LRAC downward**.
- More efficient firms **displace older firms**, leading to higher industry productivity.

### Declining Industries
- When demand for an industry’s product falls, firms exit, reducing supply and stabilizing prices at a lower equilibrium.
- Resources shift to more profitable industries.

Understanding competitive markets helps analyze pricing, output decisions, and industry dynamics over different time horizons.
