# Economic Theories

## Positive vs. Normative Economics

### Positive Statements
Positive economics deals with statements that can be tested and verified. These statements describe how the economy operates based on factual analysis.

- Example: *An increase in the minimum wage leads to higher unemployment among low-skilled workers.*
- Such statements can be confirmed or refuted using empirical evidence.

### Normative Statements
Normative economics involves value judgments and opinions about what ought to be. These statements cannot be tested purely based on facts.

- Example: *The government should increase the minimum wage to improve living standards.*
- These statements depend on societal values and perspectives.

### Why Economists Disagree
Economists often have differing views due to:
- **Differences in values**: Some prioritize efficiency, while others emphasize equity.
- **Different assumptions**: Models rely on assumptions that may vary.
- **Uncertainty in empirical data**: Data limitations and varying interpretations lead to disagreements.

## Building and Testing Economic Theories

### What Are Economic Theories?
A theory is a simplified representation of reality that explains relationships between variables. Economic theories consist of:
- **Variables**: Factors that change (e.g., price, income, supply, demand).
- **Assumptions**: Conditions under which the theory applies.
- **Predictions**: Expected outcomes based on the theory.

### The Scientific Approach in Economics
1. **Observation**: Identifying economic phenomena.
2. **Hypothesis Formation**: Proposing relationships between variables.
3. **Empirical Testing**: Using data to test predictions.
4. **Revision or Rejection**: If a theory fails, it is modified or replaced.

### Correlation vs. Causation
- **Positive correlation**: Two variables move in the same direction.
- **Negative correlation**: One variable increases while the other decreases.
- **Causation**: One variable directly affects another, which requires rigorous testing beyond correlation.

## Economic Data

### Types of Data
- **Cross-sectional data**: Observations at a single point in time (e.g., unemployment rates by province).
- **Time-series data**: Observations over time (e.g., GDP growth over decades).
- **Panel data**: Combines cross-sectional and time-series data.

### Statistical Analysis in Economics
- **Index numbers**: Represent data relative to a base period (e.g., Consumer Price Index, CPI).
- **Scatter diagrams**: Show relationships between two variables.
- **Regression analysis**: Determines the strength and nature of relationships.

### Importance of Data in Economics
Economic data helps policymakers, businesses, and individuals make informed decisions by identifying trends, testing theories, and guiding economic policy.

Understanding economic theories and data is essential for analyzing real-world economic issues and making evidence-based decisions.
