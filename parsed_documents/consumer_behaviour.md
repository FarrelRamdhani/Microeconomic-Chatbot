# Consumer Behavior

## 1. Marginal Utility Analysis

### Marginal Utility Theory
**Marginal utility (MU)** is the additional satisfaction gained from consuming one more unit of a good or service. It helps explain how consumers make choices.

### Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility
As a person consumes more units of a good, the additional utility derived from each successive unit decreases. This principle underlies consumer decision-making and the downward-sloping demand curve.

### Total Utility Maximization
Consumers maximize total utility by allocating their budget so that the marginal utility per dollar spent on each good is equal:

\[ \frac{MU_X}{P_X} = \frac{MU_Y}{P_Y} \]

where:
- **MU_X** and **MU_Y** are the marginal utilities of goods X and Y.
- **P_X** and **P_Y** are their respective prices.

### Household and Market Demand
- **Household demand**: An individual consumerâ€™s demand for goods and services.
- **Market demand**: The sum of all individual consumer demands in the market.
- **Derivation of Demand from Marginal Utility**: Since consumers buy more of a good when its price falls (to equalize MU per dollar spent), individual demand curves slope downward, forming the market demand curve.

## 2. Substitution and Income Effects

### Substitution Effect
When the price of a good falls, consumers substitute it for relatively more expensive goods, increasing its quantity demanded.

### Income Effect
A price decrease increases real income (purchasing power), allowing consumers to buy more of normal goods and less of inferior goods.

### Slope of the Demand Curve
The combined **substitution** and **income effects** explain why the demand curve slopes downward:
- For **normal goods**, both effects reinforce higher quantity demanded when price falls.
- For **inferior goods**, the income effect may offset the substitution effect but not enough to make demand slope upward.

## 3. Consumer Surplus

### Concept of Consumer Surplus
Consumer surplus measures the **difference between the highest price a consumer is willing to pay for a good and the actual price paid**. It represents the net benefit consumers receive from market transactions.

### Applications of Consumer Surplus
- **Welfare Analysis**: Helps assess the benefits of trade and price changes.
- **Price Controls**: Price ceilings increase consumer surplus but may cause shortages.
- **Taxation**: Excise taxes reduce consumer surplus by raising prices and reducing consumption.
- **Policy Decisions**: Used to evaluate public goods, subsidies, and market regulations.

Understanding consumer behavior through **marginal utility, substitution, and income effects** allows businesses and policymakers to predict demand changes and make efficient economic decisions.
